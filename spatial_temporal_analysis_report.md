# Spatial-Temporal Distribution Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

This analysis evaluates the suitability of SpatialTemporalKFold for this pollution prediction competition by examining the spatial and temporal distributions in the train.csv and test.csv datasets.

**Key Finding**: SpatialTemporalKFold is **moderately suitable** with careful parameter tuning (Score: 6/10).

## Dataset Overview

- **Train set**: 7,649 samples with 8 features
- **Test set**: 2,739 samples with 7 features (no pollution_value target)
- **Missing values**: 13 missing lat/lon values in train set, none in test set

## Spatial Distribution Analysis

### Coverage and Ranges
- **Train spatial extent**: 
  - Latitude: -74.187° to 70.094° (range: 144.281°)
  - Longitude: -161.756° to 153.388° (range: 315.144°)
- **Test spatial extent**:
  - Latitude: -47.269° to 68.049° (range: 115.318°) 
  - Longitude: -135.087° to 174.785° (range: 309.872°)

### Key Spatial Findings
✅ **Significant spatial overlap exists**: 115.318° latitude and 288.475° longitude overlap
✅ **Distributions are significantly different**: KS-test p-values < 0.001 for both lat/lon
⚠️ **Low spatial density**: Train covers only 3.5% of possible grid cells, test covers 1.8%

## Temporal Distribution Analysis

### Coverage and Patterns
- **Train temporal extent**: Full year (days 1-366), all 12 months, all hours (0-23), all weekdays (0-6)
- **Test temporal extent**: Very limited (days 2-32), only months 1-2, all hours, all weekdays

### Key Temporal Findings
🔴 **Severe temporal bias**: Test set contains almost exclusively January data (2,738/2,739 samples)
🔴 **Minimal temporal overlap**: Only 29 days overlap, with 330 days unique to train
✅ **Some temporal structure preserved**: All hours and weekdays represented in both sets

### Distribution Statistics
| Feature | Train (mean ± std) | Test (mean ± std) | Difference |
|---------|-------------------|------------------|------------|
| Day of year | 203.55 ± 79.88 | 28.41 ± 5.73 | **Major** |
| Month | 7.11 ± 2.63 | 1.00 ± 0.02 | **Extreme** |
| Hour | 11.06 ± 6.24 | 10.92 ± 3.20 | Minor |
| Day of week | 1.56 ± 1.79 | 3.20 ± 1.37 | Moderate |

## Spatial-Temporal Interaction Analysis

### Combined Patterns
- **Spatial-temporal overlap**: Only 20 combinations shared between train/test
- **Overlap ratio**: 0.052 (very low)
- **Train-only combinations**: 330
- **Test-only combinations**: 33

## Suitability Assessment for SpatialTemporalKFold

### Scoring Breakdown (6/10 points)
| Criterion | Score | Status | Notes |
|-----------|-------|--------|-------|
| Spatial overlap | 2/2 | ✅ | Substantial geographical overlap exists |
| Temporal overlap | 2/2 | ✅ | Limited but present (29 days, 2 months) |
| Statistical significance | 2/2 | ✅ | All distributions significantly different |
| Spatio-temporal overlap | 0/2 | ❌ | Very low overlap ratio (0.052) |
| Data sufficiency | 0/2 | ❌ | Limited combinations for robust CV |

### Strengths for SpatialTemporalKFold
1. **Clear spatial structure**: Global dataset with meaningful geographic variation
2. **Significant distribution differences**: Statistical tests confirm train/test differences
3. **Spatial buffering value**: Geographic overlap means spatial buffering can prevent leakage
4. **Some temporal buffering benefit**: Despite bias, temporal buffering may help

### Limitations and Concerns
1. **Severe temporal bias**: Test set is almost entirely January data
2. **Low spatio-temporal diversity**: Very few shared spatial-temporal combinations
3. **Potential instability**: Limited combinations may lead to unstable CV estimates
4. **Seasonal effects**: Strong seasonal bias may not be well-handled by buffering alone

## Recommendations

### Primary Recommendation
**Use SpatialTemporalKFold with careful parameter tuning**, but also implement and compare with:
- Stratified K-Fold by month/season
- Grouped K-Fold by geographic regions
- Time series split (if temporal ordering is available)

### Suggested Parameters
- **Spatial buffer**: 14.4 degrees (10% of smaller spatial range)
- **Temporal buffer**: 30 days
- **Number of splits**: 5-7 (balance between stability and data utilization)
- **Stratification**: Consider stratifying by month or broad geographic regions

### Implementation Strategy
1. **Primary CV**: SpatialTemporalKFold with suggested parameters
2. **Validation**: Compare with stratified K-fold by month
3. **Feature engineering**: Include strong seasonal/temporal features
4. **Model selection**: Consider models robust to temporal shift (ensemble methods)

## Potential Leakage Concerns

### High Risk Areas
1. **January clustering**: Test set heavily biased toward January may create temporal leakage
2. **Geographic clustering**: Some test locations may be very close to train locations
3. **Temporal proximity**: January test data may be temporally close to January train data

### Mitigation Strategies
1. **Implement spatial buffering**: Remove train samples within X degrees of test samples
2. **Implement temporal buffering**: Remove train samples within X days of test timeframe
3. **Cross-validation monitoring**: Track CV-LB correlation to detect leakage
4. **Feature analysis**: Avoid features that could encode test set characteristics

## Conclusion

While SpatialTemporalKFold is moderately suitable for this dataset, the severe temporal bias toward January in the test set presents significant challenges. The approach should be implemented with robust buffering parameters and compared against other CV strategies that better handle the temporal shift. The key to success will be combining spatial-temporal CV with strong seasonal feature engineering and temporal shift-robust modeling approaches.
