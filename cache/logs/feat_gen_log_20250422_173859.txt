Params: generations=8, parents=12, children=60, min_gain=0.01
[2025-04-22 17:38:59] Starting feature generation - Task: regression, Device: cuda
[2025-04-22 17:38:59] Time budget: 300 seconds
[2025-04-22 17:38:59] Dataset: 1000 samples, 25 features, Limit: 25 new features max
[2025-04-22 17:39:10] Gen 0: Training with original features. Mean Val rmse = 0.30800
[2025-04-22 17:40:40] Gen 1:
  Added 1 features, now using 26 features (1 new).
  Mean Val rmse = 0.30483.
  Score improved by 0.00317. Best generation: 1.
  Annealing: τ=1.00, β=0.79, γ=0.20, λ=0.10
[2025-04-22 17:42:08] Gen 2:
  Added 0 features, now using 26 features (1 new).
  Mean Val rmse = 0.30483.
  No improvement yet. Best generation: 1.
  Annealing: τ=0.97, β=0.78, γ=0.14, λ=0.11
[2025-04-22 17:42:08] Auto-activating adaptive exploration after 3 generations due to stalled progress
[2025-04-22 17:43:36] Gen 3:
  Added 1 features, now using 27 features (2 new).
  Mean Val rmse = 0.30098.
  Score improved by 0.00385. Best generation: 3.
  Annealing: τ=1.30, β=0.74, γ=0.19, λ=0.07
[2025-04-22 17:44:58] Time budget of 300 seconds exceeded during feature evaluation. Stopping optimization.
[2025-04-22 17:44:58] Total execution time: 359.05 seconds
[2025-04-22 17:44:58] Final generation wasn't the best. Reverting to best generation (3).
[2025-04-22 17:44:58]
